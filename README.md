# lego-park
a lego park base on opengl and brain holes.


### some tips

- @type `vec3` : means (x,y,z);
- @class `Lego` to define the lego item, which you could build a width,height,length lego mode automaticly
- @template `VecStack` to implement the Stack to my `vec3` type.



### tasks for asuka:

1. implement the template `VecStack`, could find it in `VecStack.hpp`
2. implement the class `Lego`, trying to build the lego class,base on existing code.


### ATTENTION:

when creating a new file ,you need to specific the file to the `source` folder. I tried to make it automaticly but  it doesn't work in vs2010.
